- You cannot modify the UI to hide branding
- Source code changes must be shared if distributed

### Option 2: Commercial License

Remove branding and deploy as your own product:
- White-label with your branding

- Multiple client deployments under one license (ask about agency pricing)

## FAQ

### Can I use Rapida for free in my business?

Yes, as long as Rapida branding remains visible in the UI.

### Can I modify the code?

Yes. Under GPL-2.0, you can modify the code. If you distribute your modified version, you must share the source code.

### Do I need a commercial license for internal tools?

No, if branding remains visible. A commercial license is only required to remove branding or keep modifications private.

### What if I embed Rapida in my SaaS product?

If your users see the Rapida UI (even embedded), branding must remain visible under GPL-2.0. For white-label embedding, you need a commercial license.

### Can I charge my clients for Rapida deployments?

Yes. You can charge for your services (setup, customization, support) even under the open-source license. The license doesn't restrict commercial use—only branding removal.
